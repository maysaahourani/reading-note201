## HTML aGAIN ! 
 * HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

## HEADINGS
# this is header one size
## this is header two size
### this is header three size
#### this is header four size
##### this is header five size
###### this is header six size

 that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
 start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
 line.```

 ### ***Summary FLASH, VIDEO & AUDIO***
+ Flash allows you to add animations, video and audio to
the web.
+ Flash is not supported on iPhone or iPad.
+ HTML5 introduces new <video> and <audio>
elements for adding video and audio to web pages, but
these are only supported in the latest browsers.
+ Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not
all support the same video and audio formats, so you
+ need to supply your files in different formats to ensure
that everyone can see/hear them

*summary*
* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file.
* JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
* The HTML ``<script>`` element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the`` <link>`` element can be used to load a CSS file).
* If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.

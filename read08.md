# layout 

In this chapter we are going to look at
how to control where each element sits
on a page and how to create attractive
page layouts.
This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be
different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this
chapter we will:
* Explore different ways to position elements using normal
flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
* Discover how various devices have different screen sizes
and resolution, and how this affects the design process.
* Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts,
and how they are created.
* Find out how designers use grids to make their page
designs look more professional.

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box

## HTML & CSS 
``<address>`` tag has
quite a specific use: to contain
contact details for the author of
the page

``<ins>`` can be used
to show content that has been
inserted into a document,


``<del>`` element can show text
that has been deleted from it.

``<s>`` indicates
something that is no longer
accurate or relevant (but that
should not be deleted).


## summary 

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

**There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:**

● **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

``<ol>``



● **Unordered lists** are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).


``<ul>``



● **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

+ ``<dl> <dt> <dd>`` 
definition list , definition term , definition 



+ ``<li>``
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening  tag
and a closing  tag. (The li
stands for list item.)



## summary texts of CSS

* There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.

* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
* You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.



### Border, Margin & Padding

![](fd.PNG)

Every box has three available properties that
can be adjusted to control its appearance:
1. Border
Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.
2. Margin
Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.
3. Padding
Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.








### ARRAYS

*** An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values ***


*CREATING AN ARRAY*


```var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom'];
``` 

### VALUES IN ARRAYS 
1. NUMBERING ITEMS IN
AN ARRAY
Each item in an array is
automatically given a number
called an index. This can be used
to access specific items in the
array. Consider the following
array which holds three colors:




2. ACCESSING ITEMS IN
AN ARRAY
To retrieve the third item on the
list, the array name is specified
along with the index number in
square brackets.
Here you can see a variable
called i temThree is declared.
Its value is set to be the third
color from the co 1 ors array.
var itemThr ee;
itemThree = col ors [2] ;

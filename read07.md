object-oriented model:An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods.

## HTML5: Figure and Figure Caption

``<figure>``contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.
``<figcaption>``to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.

* Before these elements were
created there was no way to
associate an ``<img>`` element with
its caption

## summary HTML images 
* The ``<img>`` element is used to add images to a
web page.
* You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.
* You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs

# Tables 
There are several types of information
that need to be displayed in a grid or
table. For example: sports results, stock
reports, train timetables.
* Each block in the grid is referred
to as a table cell. In HTML a
table is written out row by row

* Basic Table Structure

1. The ``<table>`` element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.

2. ``<tr>``You indicate the start of each
row using the opening`` <tr>`` tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)

3. Each cell of a table is
represented using a`` <td>``
element. (The td stands for
table data.)

4. The`` <th> ``element is used just
like the `` <td> `` element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.) 

5.  ``<td colspan="2">`` spaning column
6. `` <td rowspan="2">`` spanning row

7. ``<thead>``The headings of the table should
sit inside the ``<thead> ``element. 
8. ``<tbody>``
The body should sit inside the
``<tbody>`` element. 
9. <tfoot>
The footer belongs inside the
``<tfoot>`` element.

summary Tables
* The ``<table>`` element is used to add tables to a web
page.
* A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the ``<tr>`` element.
*  Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the ``<td>`` element (or`` <th> ``if it is a
header).
* You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
* For long tables you can split the table into a ``<thead>,``
``<tbody>``, and ``<tfoot>.``
